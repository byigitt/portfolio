      "content": "\r\nNext.js and TypeScript are a powerful combination for building modern web applications. In this post, I'll share some best practices and tips for using them together.\r\n\r\n## Why TypeScript with Next.js?\r\n\r\nTypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early and improves the development experience. Here are some benefits:\r\n\r\n- Better IDE support with autocompletion\r\n- Catch type-related bugs before runtime\r\n- Improved code maintainability\r\n- Better documentation through types\r\n\r\n## Code Example\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example of a type-safe API route in Next.js:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype User = {\r\n  id: number;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  email: string;\r\n};\r\n\r\nasync function getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {\r\n  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);\r\n  const user = await response.json();\r\n  return user;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Best Practices\r\n\r\n1. Always define types for your props\r\n2. Use interfaces for objects that can be extended\r\n3. Leverage Next.js's built-in TypeScript support\r\n4. Use strict mode in your tsconfig.json\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nTypeScript and Next.js together provide an excellent foundation for building robust web applications. The type safety and developer experience improvements are well worth the initial learning curve. "
