Next.js and TypeScript are a powerful combination for building modern web applications. In this post, I'll share some best practices and tips for using them together.

## Why TypeScript with Next.js?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early and improves the development experience. Here are some benefits:

- Better IDE support with autocompletion
- Catch type-related bugs before runtime
- Improved code maintainability
- Better documentation through types

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a type-safe API route in Next.js:

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

async function getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  const user = await response.json();
  return user;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always define types for your props
2. Use interfaces for objects that can be extended
3. Leverage Next.js's built-in TypeScript support
4. Use strict mode in your tsconfig.json

## Conclusion

TypeScript and Next.js together provide an excellent foundation for building robust web applications. The type safety and developer experience improvements are well worth the initial learning curve.
